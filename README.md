# ClassPlay (Beta)

**ClassPlay** is a web‑based classroom gamification platform designed to make school activities more engaging, fair, and intuitive for teachers and students.

ClassPlay helps teachers organize and run interactive class activities such as:
- Random **group distribution**
- **Recitation and student selection**
- **Presentation order and participation**
- Simple **decision systems** like dice rolls and turn order

All features are built to be used instantly in the browser with no accounts, no backend servers, and no third‑party cloud dependencies.

## Beta Features

ClassPlay (Beta) currently includes the following key tools:

### Student Management
- Add students manually or paste a list from Excel / CSV (one student per line).  
- Quick student editing before starting an activity.

### Group Activities
- **Group Spinner** – Randomly assign students into groups with optional group count.  
- **Team Draft Table** – Controlled draft distribution for balanced teams.

### Classroom Engagement Tools
- **Recitation Roulette** – Random student selector that avoids repeats.  
- **Pass‑the‑Token** – Sequential participation rotation for class activities.  

### Presentation & Order Systems
- **Turn Order Reveal** – Determine presentation or speaking sequence.  
- **Dice & Randomizer Hub** – Dice roll, coin flip, and number pick for in‑class decisions.

### Topic & Icebreaker Tools
- **Topic Reveal Board** – Reveal topics, roles, or questions to students.  
- **Mystery Box Picker** – Fun reveal for roles or classroom prompts.

## What “Beta” Means

This version is labeled **Beta** because:
- Core systems are functional and ready for classroom use.
- Additional UI polish, animations, and game refinements may still be in development.
- Features are stable for everyday use, but feedback and iteration are expected.

## Design Philosophy

ClassPlay is built around:
- **Fast setup** – Open in a browser and start immediately.  
- **Zero accounts** – No login or student profiles needed.  
- **Privacy‑first** – No student data is stored on servers.  
- **Teacher control** – Manual overrides and session control remain with teachers.

ClassPlay aims to bring playful structure and participation tools to classrooms of all sizes.
